## Usage ##

####1. Shortcode

Insert the shortcode anywhere on your page or post that you want the form to be displayed to the user.

Basic: _requires the user to enter amount and email to complete payment_
```
[flw-pay-button]
```

With button text:
```
[flw-pay-button]Button Text[/flw-pay-button]
```

With attributes: _email_ or _use_current_user_email_ with value "yes", _amount_
```
[flw-pay-button amount="1290" email="customer@email.com" ]

or

[flw-pay-button amount="1290" use_current_user_email="yes" ]
```

With attributes and button text: _email_, _amount_
```
[flw-pay-button amount="1290" email="customer@email.com" ]Button Text[/flw-pay-button]
```

####2. Visual Composer

The shortcode can be added via Visual Composer elements.
